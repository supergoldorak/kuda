<h2><font color='#336699'>What is Kuda?</font></h2>

**Kuda** is an advanced JavaScript library and World Editor that enables web developers to quickly build interactive 3D web solutions. It abstracts the complexity of 3D behaviors into easy to use building blocks for common functions, allowing developers to create compelling user experiences by setting up a complex sequence of events that respond to user input. Kuda is named after and in honor of the [Plymouth Hemi Barracuda](http://www.google.com/search?q=plymouth+hemi+cuda&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1280&bih=937).

**Kuda** is a library of features such as advanced camera controls, transform manipulation, event sequencing, and more. Kuda's browser-based World Editor uses this library to give subject matter experts and non-programmers an intuitive environment for creating engaging 3D content without needing to code.

Other library components include a HUD, sprites, curve system, texture sets, doors, windows, and a pressure engine. The Kuda World Editor's features include Model Browser, Animation, Camera Viewpoints, Particle Effects, HUD, Fog, Messaging (Interaction and Behavior), and Basic Shapes.

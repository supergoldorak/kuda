<h2><font color='#336699'>Contributor License Agreement</font></h2>

## Why ##
We ask that all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to the Kuda project complete, sign, and submit via email a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) [downloads/ContributorLicenseAgreement PDF form ]. The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the project and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time. A signed CLA is required to be on file before an individual's contribution is accepted by the project.

## How ##
CLAs may be submitted by emailing a scan of the signed copy to the project lead. You can also fill out the pdf document, create a detached gpg signature, and send both the document and the detached signature via email.

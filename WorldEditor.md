## <font color='#336699'>World Editor</font> ##

The World Editor is meant to run on an Express web server using NodeJS. However, you can experiment with the Editor on this site to check it out without having to download and run it yourself. The World Editor works with the following exceptions:

  * 'Save Project' will not work
  * 'Open Project' will not work

You will also be limited to the 3D models we have uploaded to this site. If you want to experiment with one, you can select the 'Load Model' menu option from the World Editor and enter any of the following:
```
assets/ScenarioB_v017/ScenarioB_v017.dae
assets/house_v12/house_v12.dae
assets/TinyHouse_v07/TinyHouse_v07.dae
```

We hope you enjoy checking it out though!
